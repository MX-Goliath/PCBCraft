# PCB editor performance — 22.10.2026

## Observed problem

The local Windows dev build repeatedly rebuilt display geometry, tested every
visible object against the pointer, and triangulated the board outline. A native
15,513-object, 23-layer PcbDoc research copy reproduced the reported slowdown.
Opening 3D also built the complete scene and rasterized it on the UI thread.

## Changes

- Bound document-space geometry caches to the document revision and explicit
  preview generation: bounds, board outline/triangles, padstack outlines, drills,
  and resolved paste/solder masks. Zoom, pan and selection reuse this geometry.
- Reject pointer candidates by cached bounds before exact hit testing. Exact
  layer-aware tests, ordering, masks and model geometry remain the same.
- Share the preview through Arc; connection results use generation keys instead
  of whole-board equality. Identical mouse-drag frames reuse the preview, while
  rotation, release and revision changes still update/validate/commit it.
- Use hashed selection membership and indexed handle lookup for large groups.
- Prepare 3D scenes and images on bounded background workers, coalescing changes.
  A result for another document revision/body setting is discarded. During camera
  movement the previous image may remain visible; picking waits for the matching
  camera, dimensions, selection and display settings. Worker failure is shown in
  the viewport. No GPU or GUI dependencies were added to eda-core.
- Calculate triangle projections/materials once before sorting the 3D image.
- Enable opt-level 2 in normal dev builds, including dependencies. Debug symbols,
  assertions and incremental compilation remain enabled on Windows and Linux.

## Reproduction and measurements

Run the read-only probe with a native board path:

```powershell
.\scripts\dev.ps1 -Task run -Package eda-app -ExtraArgs @('--example','pcb_frame_profile','--','INPUT.PcbDoc','--3d')
```

The probe uses an egui viewport of 1000×800, 15 px/mm, the board-outline centre,
default display configuration and default-font aliases. It measures CPU painting
and egui tessellation; it excludes file loading, other panels, GPU submission and
presentation. These numbers are not measured window FPS or an Altium comparison.

| Case | Original unoptimized dev build | Updated optimized dev build |
|---|---:|---:|
| 2D cold paint + tessellation | 201 ms | about 55 ms |
| 2D cursor, ten-frame mean | 148 ms | 22.5 ms |
| 2D pan, ten-frame mean | 153 ms | 23.0 ms |
| First 3D frame on UI thread | 14,765 ms | about 10 ms to request work |
| 3D scene + first image | synchronous, included above | about 869 ms in background |
| UI frames while preparing 3D | blocked | maximum about 0.9 ms in this probe |
| 3D orbit image refresh | synchronous | about 554 ms in background; UI frames ≤0.5 ms |

The build-profile change contributes to the total improvement. Before enabling
compiler optimization, geometry caching and broad-phase picking alone reduced
warm unoptimized 2D paint+tessellation from approximately 150 ms to 90–100 ms.
Timings vary with zoom, visibility, board contents and CPU load.

## Verification and remaining limits

Regression coverage checks geometry equality/reuse/expiry, preview rotation and
release/Undo, stale worker rejection, bounded pending work, texture reuse and 3D
navigation. Windows GUI verification uses the research copy only: Fit Board,
select/move via, Undo, scrolling, Page Up, 2D/3D switching and 3D zoom. The source Altium
project is not saved or modified.

Validation passed: 273 workspace tests, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, Windows dev build and
Linux GNU all-targets cross-check (no Linux linking or distributable).

The complete 3D image still uses a software rasterizer. Its refresh can lag during
continuous orbit; background rendering makes the window responsive, but does not
establish a 60 FPS 3D renderer. Polygon repour, validated model copies during
editing, larger boards and other zoom/visibility configurations can still be
expensive. Full Altium rendering/performance parity is not claimed. Linux is
cross-checked with all targets; native Linux performance/UI is not measured and
no Linux distributable is built in this stage.
